This is a *learning* project aimed at learning to create ReactJS apps. It's purpose is to find overlaping time slots when you have many different time schedules and want to avoid manual work. The name comes from the time when I was a student at the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/) and was helping the committee of the Public Speaking Society (sadly it is now defunct...).

See a quick demo here:

>**Warning** This project was created in 2017 and was **never** meant to be used in live production! At this point, it is broken *but* you can still download compiled version and give it a try. Compilation is broken but compiled versino should work fine. **Warning**

For more technical details, see [Addendum.MD](Addendum.MD).
